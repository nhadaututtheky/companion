# Changelog

All notable changes to Companion are documented here.

## [0.21.7] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **License / RTK Pro gate silently stuck on Free** — `GET /api/license` had TWO Hono handlers: a legacy flat-shape version in `routes/health.ts` and the canonical wrapped `{success, data}` version in `routes/index.ts`. Hono resolved the first-registered (flat) handler, so every web consumer that read `res.data.tier` / `res.data.features` got `undefined` and silently fell back to the Free-tier defaults. Symptom: users on Pro/Trial/Dev-mode saw the correct tier badge in the settings panel (which read the flat shape directly) but `useLicenseStore` stayed at `tier: "free"` and `rtk-settings` hid every Pro strategy.
- **Settings → License activation form** now reads the wrapped `GET` response at `res.data.tier` (the flat `res.tier` path was the only thing holding the flat handler in place — fixed both sides of the mismatch).

### Internal
- Dropped the shadow handler in `packages/server/src/routes/health.ts` with a breadcrumb comment explaining the removal. `GET /api/license` is now exclusively served by `routes/index.ts` with `satisfies ApiResponse`.

## [0.21.6] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **CI Quality Gates green** — removed the lone `no-useless-escape` error in `diagram-generator.ts` (`\[` inside a character class is redundant) that was failing the lint job on `main` even though v0.21.5 tag builds were green.
- **Settings / tip-banner React 19 compliance** — refactored three `set-state-in-effect` violations (`DesktopTab`, `TipsSection`, `TipBanner`) to derive state at render via lazy `useState` initializers or `useMemo`, eliminating cascading re-renders flagged by the React 19 ESLint plugin.

### Internal
- `TipBanner` no longer uses a 300ms fade transition on dismiss — the early `return null` made the opacity animation dead code anyway. Selection logic now runs in `useMemo` keyed on a `dismissCounter` that bumps on dismiss to force `availableTips` to re-filter against `localStorage`.

## [0.21.5] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Claude CLI 2.1+ compatibility** — Replaced removed `--thinking-budget` flag with `--effort low|medium|high|xhigh|max` (mapped from `thinking_mode`). Previously any session with `thinking_mode = "deep"` silently failed to apply extended thinking.
- **Context window defaulted correctly** — `getMaxContextTokens(model, mode)` now returns 200K by default. Previously Opus/Sonnet sessions reported 1M even when the CLI was actually using 200K, breaking compact thresholds and `/info` progress bars.
- **Opus 4.5 / Sonnet 4.5 context** — Correctly reports 200K (they never supported 1M). Previously treated as 1M-capable.
- **Haiku 4.5 thinking mode** — `modelSupportsDeepThinking` / bare alias detection now covers Haiku 4.5 and the `opus`/`sonnet` shorthands Claude Code CLI accepts.
- **Context-estimator + Telegram /info + settings panel** — All now read `state.context_mode` instead of hardcoding `model.includes("haiku") ? 200k : 1M`.

### Added
- **1M context beta toggle (web + Telegram)** — New-session modal shows a 200K / 1M switch next to MODEL (only when the selected model supports 1M). Active-session header exposes `ContextModeSelector` for live switching; Telegram settings panel gains matching `panel:ctx:200k|1m` buttons. Toggling re-applies the model with the `[1m]` suffix via `set_model` control_request so the CLI opts in without a restart.
- **`set_context_mode` WS message type** — handled in `ws-user-message.ts` and broadcast as `session_update` so every client stays in sync.

### Internal
- `SessionState.context_mode?: "200k" | "1m"` — persisted and surfaced to browsers.
- `applyContextSuffix(model, mode)` / `modelSupports1M(model)` — single source of truth for `[1m]` suffix logic across adapter, UI, Telegram.
- Deprecated `thinkingModeTobudget` (CLI no longer honors it); use `thinkingModeToEffort`.

## [0.21.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Multi-Account Manager Phase 4 — Topbar Indicator** — `AccountIndicator` component shows the active account's status dot + label directly in the header, with a dropdown offering instant "Switch to next ready" and "Manage accounts" shortcuts. Full WAI-ARIA menu pattern (arrow-key navigation, Home/End, Escape returns focus, aria-haspopup/controls).

### Fixed
- **Telegram rate-limit label** — `account_rate_limited` notifications now carry the real account label instead of showing "Unknown" (resolved at emission time in `claude-adapter`).
- **Auto-switch deadlock** — Auto-switch now falls back to `skip-in-rotation` accounts when every non-skipped candidate is rate-limited, instead of silently leaving the session stuck.
- **Round-robin tiebreaker drift** — `findNextReady` computes its cost tiebreaker from a scoped `SUM(sessions.total_cost_usd) WHERE accountId IN (...)` query rather than the denormalized `accounts.totalCostUsd` column that can drift.
- **Orphaned session history** — `deleteAccount` wraps the delete in a transaction that first nulls `sessions.accountId`, preserving per-session cost history while removing the account.

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Smart Orchestration UI** — Dispatch suggestion badge in message composer. When the task classifier detects a workflow/debate pattern (confidence >= 0.5), a compact banner appears with pattern icon, confidence %, override dropdown, and confirm/dismiss buttons. Fully wired: EventBus → WebSocket → Zustand store → UI.
- **Architecture Diagrams** — New "Architecture" tab in AI Context panel. Generates Mermaid diagrams from CodeGraph data: architecture overview (community clusters), module dependency trees, and call flow diagrams. Client-side Mermaid rendering with dark theme.
- **CodeGraph Intelligence (5 phases)** — Community detection (Leiden algorithm) with AI cluster labels, pre-commit impact analysis with blast radius scoring, auto-reindex on file changes (debounced 5s), skills generator (4 Claude skill files per project), and diagram generator.
- **MCP Tools for Wiki KB + CodeGraph** — `companion_wiki_search`, `companion_wiki_save`, `companion_codegraph_search`, `companion_codegraph_impact`, `companion_codegraph_diagram`, `companion_generate_skills` — autonomous agent access to knowledge base and code intelligence.
- **Dispatch Preview API** — `GET/POST /api/sessions/dispatch-preview` (regex-only sync + AI-powered async) and `POST /api/sessions/dispatch-confirm` for programmatic orchestration control.

### Changed
- Smart Orchestration pipeline now auto-classifies every user message (non-blocking, async) and emits `dispatch:classified` events to all connected browsers.
- `MessageComposer` accepts `sessionId` prop for session-scoped dispatch suggestions.
- Cleaned up 9 completed plan files (audit-fixes, perf phases).

### Fixed
- Cross-session dispatch suggestion contamination — store filters by sessionId.
- Dispatch confirm race condition — suggestion cleared only after successful API response.
- Input length validation on dispatch preview endpoints (GET: 2000 chars, POST: 10000 chars).
- Single-pattern suggestions filtered out (no UI intervention needed for single-session tasks).

### Fixed
- **Orphan Hooks Cleanup** — Companion now cleans up `.claude/settings.local.json` hooks on shutdown + startup, preventing ECONNREFUSED when running Claude Code standalone.
- **Codex/Gemini/OpenCode adapter fixes** — cwd propagation, tool_result typing, randomUUID for tool IDs, send() warns on non-interactive stdin.
- **New Session Modal** — SSR-safe localStorage, model sync on platform change, template model validation per platform.

### Changed

### Added

### Fixed
- ANSI strip: removed `|/-\` from progress/spinner regex to prevent false-positive deletion of markdown tables and log lines
- Error aggregate: preserved line ordering (interleave non-error lines at original positions)
- Boilerplate: use replacements map instead of mutating input array mid-loop
- RTK config: internal try/catch so DB errors don't crash server startup
- Cache cleanup on all session exit paths (sweep, scheduled timer, kill)
